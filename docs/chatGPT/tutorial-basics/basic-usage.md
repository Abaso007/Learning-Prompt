If you haven't used ChatGPT or similar chatbot products much before, let me briefly explain its basic usage:

- After logging into ChatGPT, you can simply enter your question or command in the input box. The AI will respond with the corresponding content. In the following chapters, I will explain in more detail the usage and techniques:

- Additionally, there is something special to note about ChatGPT compared to other AI products you may have used before. It supports multi-turn conversations. For example, when you ask "What is the capital of China?", it answers "Beijing". You can then follow up with "How many people are there?" without needing to repeat the word "Beijing" in your question. ChatGPT understands that "there" refers to "Beijing".
