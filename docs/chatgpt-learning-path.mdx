## If you want to learn systematically

- If you're not very familiar with AI, Prompt Engineering, or even ChatGPT, I suggest starting from the basics. The basics explain AI products for total beginners, or in other words, focus more on prompts.
- If you already know the basics and want to learn building better AI products and more prompt engineering, you can jump straight to the advanced sections.

## If you just want a quickstart

- If you just want a quick overview of AI product tips, go through the tips section which summarizes everything.
- If you already know the basics but want more use cases, check out the resources & product recommendations.

## How to read

You can run the ChatGPT prompt examples directly in the doc. Note this uses the [Dyno](https://trydyno.com/) embed feature. If you don't see the examples below, check your network settings and browser JS permissions. If visible, click Generate. It will first prompt you to enter your personal ChatGPT API key (don't worry, stored locally only) to run the examples:

<div
  trydyno-embed=""
  openai-model="text-davinci-003"
  initial-prompt="What is the capital of China?"
  initial-response="The capital of China is Beijing. "
  max-tokens="256"
  box-rows="3"
  model-temp="0.7"
  top-p="1"
