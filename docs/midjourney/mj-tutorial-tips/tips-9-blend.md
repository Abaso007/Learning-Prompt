# Tip 9: The Mysterious Blend Feature

To be honest, I hesitate to call this a technique - it's a very unstable Midjourney feature. But it's quite important so I'll introduce it.

It's simple to use - in Discord, type /blend then click the blend menu:

Your input will change to this:

Click the boxes to select two images from your computer, then hit enter to generate the blend.

Then Midjourney generates this awesome result with Fusion Iron Man on the left and Fusion Buzz Lightyear on the right:

I was shocked when I first saw this - it's like fusing monsters together in Yu-Gi-Oh! Unfortunately it's very unstable and only works if multiple unknown conditions are met.

I wanted to use this for avatars but found blending my own photos with other styles rarely works well. It seems best with celebrity photos, likely because Midjourney has been trained extensively on those.

But I think it has great potential for easily creating unique avatars by blending your photo with something else. Unfortunately it's not very usable yet.

It also has many other applications which I'll cover later.
