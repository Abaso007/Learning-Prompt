# Tip 14: Add Styles - Time Periods

The old photos used 1990s style - strictly speaking, decades fit better in subject or environment, but works in style too since we want both 90s subjects and a 90s style.

This is the last style word usage - time periods.

Modifying the illustration prompts, I didn't specify artists, just style of 1920s. The rose has the right vibe, the cat top right is hilarious.
