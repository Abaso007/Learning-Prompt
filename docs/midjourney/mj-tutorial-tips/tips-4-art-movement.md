# Tip 4: Adding Style - Art Movements

> For length I won't cover many styles here, but I'll share more on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hellojimmywong) - follow me there for updates.

Some of the logos generated earlier may seem a bit plain. This isn't because Midjourney lacks capability, but because our prompts were too simple. Adding just a couple words can create very different logos.

The 4 on the left used this prompt - I just added "Pop Art" to the original:

```other
letter A logo, lettermark, typography, vector simple, Pop Art
```

### What is Pop Art?

Pop art is an art movement that emerged in the 1950s and 1960s. It emphasizes reflection on and expression of popular culture, mass media, and consumerist culture. "Pop" comes from "popular art," a term coined in 1956 by British art critic Lawrence Alloway.

Characteristics of Pop Art:

- Focuses on common everyday objects and imagery like advertisements, magazine covers, product packaging.
- Uses bold, bright colors, clean lines, emphasizes visual impact.

The 4 on the right used this prompt - I added "De Stijl":

```other
letter A logo, lettermark, typography, vector simple,De Stijl
```

### What is De Stijl?

De Stijl was a Dutch art movement starting in 1917 aimed at visual simplification using straight lines, planes and primary colors.

Members included painters like Piet Mondrian and Theo van Doesburg. De Stijl sought to integrate art and design to create aesthetics that were practical and functional.

Characteristics of De Stijl:

- Heavy use of geometric forms like rectangles and straight lines.
- Limited color palette sticking to primaries like black, white, gray, red, yellow, blue.
- Pursuit of balance and harmony, focus on form and structure over detail and expression.

With this context, you can see how the logos take on that stylistic flavor.
