# Tip 6: Use "no" to remove unwanted elements

In the badge logo examples, you may have also seen single-color emblems like school crests. Midjourney tends to generate complex outputs, so for simplicity you can add color, background, etc. to the prompt.

Another technique is using "no". For example, I wanted a single-color school crest focused on a book. I also wanted to remove text since Midjourney isn't great with words. My prompt with "no realistic color text" at the end:

```other
emblem for a university with large book, vintage --no realistic color text
```

I also added "no text" to the instant noodle prompt. Results (note that for logos, "no text" sometimes doesn't work with -- but removing the -- fixes it, likely a bug):
