# Tip 5: Adding Style - Artists

> For length I won't cover many styles here, but I'll share more on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hellojimmywong) - follow me there for updates.

The previous chapter covered adding art movements to make images more unique. This chapter teaches another method - adding artist names.

First, note that while Midjourney supports most art movements, its support for individual artists is more limited. Through tireless community effort, as of March 31, 2023, over 2000 artists are supported on V4 and over 100 on V5.
Of logo designers, only [Paul Rand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Rand) and [Saul Bass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Bass)ï¼Œare supported. Paul designed logos for IBM, UPS, and NeXT. Saul designed logos for United Airlines and AT&T.

```

You don't have to use actual logo designers. Adding any artist can be interesting. The 4 on the right use Piet Mondrian, and the 3rd has that Composition II in Red, Blue, and Yellow style. The 4 on the left use Paul Rand - the 2nd with the red frame and black A has his iconic eyeglasses logo. I love it:

When adding artists, be aware:

1. All outputs may look very similar - artists with strong signature styles like Piet Mondrian will give that style.
2. Output may not resemble the artist - Two possibilities: the model hasn't learned the artist, or your prompt contains conflicting elements. E.g. using "Leonardo da Vinci" but prompt subject is an anime girl.

PS: See my Artist List for artists I like.

## Badge Logos

School emblems are a typical example of badge logos. These are also simple - just change the logo type to "emblem". Vintage style also works well with badges. Prompt:

```other
emblem for a Instant Noodles company, vintage, simple minimal
```

The 4 on the right use vintage - very retro, I really like them:
