# Scenario 4: Illustrations

## Let's summarize what we've learned

Through the previous lessons, you should have imitated some images by now. If not, I recommend practicing more - there's no substitute for hands-on experience.

Let's quickly summarize what we've learned:

- The core of writing prompts is to "describe the image you want clearly and in detail". The more detailed, the closer the output will match your requirements.
- The best way to improve prompt writing skills is to imitate others' work, then try writing yourself, and finally look at others' prompts.
- To describe images clearly, you can break it down from these aspects:

|                        | **Stock Image**                                      | **Logo**                        |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| What type?             | stock photo of                                       | graphic logo of                 |
| What's the subject?    | two Asian men in suits shaking hands                 | cat                             |
| What's the background? | in front of the main entrance of the office building | null(not needed for this scene) |
| How's the composition? | focus on two hands                                   | null(not needed for this scene) |
| What style?            | background bokeh                                     | vector simple minimal           |

- For style, there are two useful techniques - adding art movements and artist names.

## Watercolor

Starting this chapter, we'll look at some more complex designs. Watercolor illustrations are probably more appealing to kids.

Let's follow the template we learned:

|                        | **Prompt**       | **Explanation**                                             |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| What type?             | light watercolor | watercolor                                                  |
| What's the subject?    | a sleeping cat   | a sleeping cat                                              |
| What's the background? | white background | watercolors are usually on white paper, so white background |
| How's the composition? | null             | not too important, let AI improvise                         |
| What style?            | Studio Ghibli    | I like the Ghibli style                                     |

Let's try one with a scene:

|                        | **Prompt**                    | **Explanation**                                             |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| What type?             | light watercolor              | watercolor                                                  |
| What's the subject?    | children playing on the beach | children playing on the beach                               |
| What's the background? | white background              | watercolors are usually on white paper, so white background |
| How's the composition? | null                          | not too important, let AI improvise                         |
| What style?            | Jon Klassen                   | I like this illustrator, e.g. This Is Not My Hat            |

## Botanical Illustration

In addition to watercolor, I also like botanical illustrations. Let's draw some roses:

|                        | **Prompt**             | **Explanation**                       |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| What type?             | botanical illustration | botanical illustration                |
| What's the subject?    | types of rose          | I want to draw roses for illustration |
| What's the background? | white background       | usually on white paper                |
| How's the composition? | null                   | not too important, let AI improvise   |
| What style?            | Pierre-Joseph Redoute  | famous botanical artist               |

Let's also draw some dinosaurs:

|                        | **Prompt**                       | **Explanation**                                               |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| What type?             | dinosaur scientific illustration | dinosaur scientific illustration                              |
| What's the subject?    | Tyrannosaurus                    | Tyrannosaurus                                                 |
| What's the background? | white background                 | usually on white paper                                        |
| How's the composition? | null                             | not too important, let AI improvise                           |
| What style?            | Andrey Atuchin                   | famous Russian paleoartist, biologist, scientific illustrator |

Here are the results. Midjourney doesn't seem to know T. rex only had two legs! But the first resembles Andrey Atuchin's style a lot:

## Children's Book Illustration

I feel that just using Tip 5 - adding artist names can produce decent children's book illustrations. I haven't read that many, but many know Peter Rabbit. Let's try a cat in a similar style:

|                        | **Prompt**                                               | **Explanation**                                       |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| What type?             | illustration                                             | illustration                                          |
| What's the subject?    | A cat standing and running on two legs in a denim jacket | I want to draw a cat standing and running on two legs |
| What's the background? | null                                                     | not too important, let AI improvise                   |
| How's the composition? | null                                                     | not too important, let AI improvise                   |
| What style?            | Beatrix Potter                                           | She wrote Peter Rabbit                                |

Let's also try the style of E.H. Shepard, Winnie the Pooh's illustrator (the 4 on the right). To make it resemble his style more, I didn't include much background:

![MJ045.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/d845172f-becd-4255-bf79-d722098b2d83/doc/15EA26B6-9B49-4076-B8D8-DFE53ABD52C8/C6E53F67-725B-4C66-B45D-6A1334DABBB9_2/Bc5LzQTZ4l7BiACfFKFZjKqrU3x5Mo1s7GVHH007IB4z/MJ045.png)

## Behance Tech Illustration Style

Honestly this isn't a real illustration style, but as someone in tech I think it's pretty useful. Note that just adding "tech illustration" gives a similar style but lower quality. Adding "behance style" (Behance being a site where designers share work, often tech-related like app designs) makes the output more polished and aesthetically pleasing:

|                        | **Prompt**                    | **Explanation**                               |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| What type?             | tech illustration             | tech illustration                             |
| What's the subject?    | man jogging by the waterfront | a man jogging by the waterfront               |
| What's the background? | null                          | not too important, let AI improvise           |
| How's the composition? | null                          | not too important, let AI improvise           |
| What style?            | style of behance              | adding this makes the style more Behance-like |

I also tried a coffeeshop scene that many are familiar with:

|                     | **Prompt**                                       | **Explanation**                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| What's the subject? | a lady drinking coffee at the computer in a cafe | a lady drinking coffee on her computer at a cafe |

Results:

Finally, there's a mysterious parameter - adding some company names like "by Microsoft" seems to produce subtle differences, though I'm not sure how Midjourney interprets this. The 4 on the left use Microsoft, the 4 on the right use Apple. Aside from the Apple logo in #4, I can't really tell the difference - maybe it uses the brand colors?

If interested, please explore and share your findings(ðŸ†˜ Collecting examples)

## Coloring Book Illustrations

Finally, this may not count as an illustration style, but many have likely seen coloring books you can fill in with crayons or markers. I think it's great for kids to generate these, print them out, and color them in. Here's an example prompt for a T. rex:

|                        | **Prompt**               | **Explanation**                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| What type?             | clean coloring book page | coloring book                       |
| What's the subject?    | Tyrannosaurus            | Tyrannosaurus                       |
| What's the background? | null                     | not too important, let AI improvise |
| How's the composition? | null                     | not too important, let AI improvise |
| What style?            | black and white          | black and white style               |

Just change the subject to "Snow White" for that version. Results:
