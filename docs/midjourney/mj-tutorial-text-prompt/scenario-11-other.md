# Scenario 11: Miscellaneous

This chapter covers some of my favorite scenes that don't fit other categories. After writing this though, I realized they're all great for creating physical goods!

## Stickers

Not sure if others also like sticking stickers on laptops like I do. While sites like AliExpress are great, my tastes are pretty niche and hard to satisfy there. So I tried having AI generate some custom stickers, using Stormtroopers and Darth Vader as examples:

|                              | **Prompt**         | **Explanation**                             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| What is the type?            | sticker            | Making a sticker                            |
| What is the subject?         | Stormtrooper, cute | Cute chibi Stormtrooper                     |
| What is the environment?     | null               | Not critical, let AI decide                 |
| What is the composition?     | null               | Not critical, let AI decide                 |
| What is the shooting medium? | null               | Not critical, let AI decide                 |
| What is the style?           | vector             | Added vector since I'm thinking of printing |
| Parameters                   | null               | No parameters                               |

The results have nice white borders and vector art style suitable for printing (great for AliExpress sellers!):

## Papercutting

I really like layered papercutting art but it's quite difficult to make manually. So I tried with AI:

|                              | **Prompt**                                  | **Explanation**                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| What is the type?            | layered paper art                           | Layered paper shadowbox                                                                                                        |
| What is the subject?         | Death Star, shadowbox, volumetric lighting, | The Death Star, but I don't just want a flat shadow, I want a 3D shadowbox with lighting like products I've seen on AliExpress |
| What is the environment?     | null                                        | Not critical, let AI decide                                                                                                    |
| What is the composition?     | null                                        | Not critical, let AI decide                                                                                                    |
| What is the shooting medium? | null                                        | Not critical, let AI decide                                                                                                    |
| What is the style?           | null                                        | Not critical, let AI decide                                                                                                    |
| Parameters                   | null                                        | No parameters                                                                                                                  |

The initial results were decent but the lit sphere in frame 3 didn't look right. Frames 2 and 4 were closer to the layered 2D paper look I wanted, so I added "diorama" to enhance the flat shadowbox style.

voil√†~ The addition really improved it (right 4 images) - so beautiful, hope to find on AliExpress someday:

## Postage Stamps

Not sure if people still know about postage stamps in 2023, but I still collect them as a hobby. Thought it'd be fun to generate some retro Star Wars designs:

|                              | **Prompt**               | **Explanation**                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| What is the type?            | vintage postage stamp    | Vintage stamp                                                                                                                             |
| What is the subject?         | Stormtrooper, red ink,   | Stormtrooper and Darth Vader again. Specified red ink color.                                                                              |
| What is the environment?     | null                     | Not critical, let AI decide                                                                                                               |
| What is the composition?     | null                     | Not critical, let AI decide                                                                                                               |
| What is the shooting medium? | null                     | Not critical, let AI decide                                                                                                               |
| What is the style?           | line engraving, intaglio | Traditional stamps used plate printing, often line engraved and etched. So I added those terms - one for line engraving, one for etching. |
| Parameters                   | null                     | No parameters                                                                                                                             |

The final images are so artistic:

## Posters

Finally, let's look at posters:

|                              | **Prompt**                 | **Explanation**                            |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| What is the type?            | movie poster               |                                            |
| What is the subject?         | Star War                   |                                            |
| What is the environment?     | null                       | Not critical, let AI decide                |
| What is the composition?     | null                       | Not critical, let AI decide                |
| What is the shooting medium? | null                       | Not critical, let AI decide                |
| What is the style?           | studio ghibli, retro anime | I wanted a retro Studio Ghibli anime style |
| Parameters                   | null                       | No parameters                              |

Posters don't have to just be movie posters - you can also make advertising posters by changing the type:

|                              | **Prompt**                                  | **Explanation**             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| What is the type?            | advertising poster                          |                             |
| What is the subject?         | Darth Vader points his finger at the viewer |                             |
| What is the environment?     | null                                        | Not critical, let AI decide |
| What is the composition?     | null                                        | Not critical, let AI decide |
| What is the shooting medium? | null                                        | Not critical, let AI decide |
| What is the style?           | studio ghibli, retro anime                  | Same as above               |
| Parameters                   | null                                        | No parameters               |

## Tip 17: Reconstructing Prompts

Simplest way is just asking the creator.

If you can't, Midjourney has an image-to-prompt feature. First enter /describe:

![MJ092.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/d845172f-becd-4255-bf79-d722098b2d83/doc/15EA26B6-9B49-4076-B8D8-DFE53ABD52C8/1F561044-20D9-4FEB-BC08-B59BBFB872E1_2/Pu4U2CcTsM6jbPy40CPQxi6Cqm92cP9yvPqUDgJYtY4z/MJ092.png)

Click describe, then upload image and hit enter.

![MJ093.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/d845172f-becd-4255-bf79-d722098b2d83/doc/15EA26B6-9B49-4076-B8D8-DFE53ABD52C8/0B2596AD-17E5-41D3-B34A-697FAF8DEEBD_2/vYKAgEFUwNbRALujXI1KsSUVVUJIFZUv6qxa6CRRC9kz/MJ093.png)

Midjourney will return possible prompts - click the 1,2,3,4 buttons under the image to directly send prompts to the bot for image generation. On the right are images generated from prompt #1 and #4. It seems decent for reverse engineering composition, subject, style of original images, but don't expect identical results:
