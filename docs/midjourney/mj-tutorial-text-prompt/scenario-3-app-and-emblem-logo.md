# Scenario 3: App & Badge Logos

The logo chapter is quite long, so I've split it into two parts.

## App Logos

App logos can just use the brand logos from the previous chapter plus a squared rectangle - easy to do in Figma in a few steps ðŸ˜‚. But if you really don't want to use Figma, you can also generate app logos with Midjourney.

Look at the apps on your phone and think about how you would write prompts for app logos.

Using the previous examples, I wrote two prompts with the following results:

Key points:

- Logo type: mobile app logo
- Logo graphic description:
  - iOS uses rounded rectangles: squared with round edges
  - Graphic description, e.g. an icon for an instant noodle company
- Style:
  - Use the methods from the previous chapter, I added pop art here

```other
squared with round edges mobile app logo, an icon for a Instant Noodles company, pop art
```

I also found that adding "an icon for" before the logo graphic works better. On the right I added it, left I didn't:

Graphic, lettermark and geometric logo graphics also work well:

## Tip 5: Adding Style - Artists

> For length I won't cover many styles here, but I'll share more on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hellojimmywong) - follow me there for updates.

The previous chapter covered adding art movements to make images more unique. This chapter teaches another method - adding artist names.

First, note that while Midjourney supports most art movements, its support for individual artists is more limited. Through tireless community effort, as of March 31, 2023, over 2000 artists are supported on V4 and over 100 on V5.
Of logo designers, only [Paul Rand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Rand) and [Saul Bass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Bass)ï¼Œare supported. Paul designed logos for IBM, UPS, and NeXT. Saul designed logos for United Airlines and AT&T.

```other
letter A logo, lettermark, typography, vector simple, by Paul Rand
```

You don't have to use actual logo designers. Adding any artist can be interesting. The 4 on the right use Piet Mondrian, and the 3rd has that Composition II in Red, Blue, and Yellow style. The 4 on the left use Paul Rand - the 2nd with the red frame and black A has his iconic eyeglasses logo. I love it:

When adding artists, be aware:

1. All outputs may look very similar - artists with strong signature styles like Piet Mondrian will give that style.
2. Output may not resemble the artist - Two possibilities: the model hasn't learned the artist, or your prompt contains conflicting elements. E.g. using "Leonardo da Vinci" but prompt subject is an anime girl.

PS: See my Artist List for artists I like.

## Badge Logos

School emblems are a typical example of badge logos. These are also simple - just change the logo type to "emblem". Vintage style also works well with badges. Prompt:

```other
emblem for a Instant Noodles company, vintage, simple minimal
```

The 4 on the right use vintage - very retro, I really like them:

## Tip 6: Use "no" to remove unwanted elements

In the badge logo examples, you may have also seen single-color emblems like school crests. Midjourney tends to generate complex outputs, so for simplicity you can add color, background, etc. to the prompt.

Another technique is using "no". For example, I wanted a single-color school crest focused on a book. I also wanted to remove text since Midjourney isn't great with words. My prompt with "no realistic color text" at the end:

```other
emblem for a university with large book, vintage --no realistic color text
```

I also added "no text" to the instant noodle prompt. Results (note that for logos, "no text" sometimes doesn't work with -- but removing the -- fixes it, likely a bug):
